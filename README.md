# Bank_account_Project
It's a simple program whics simulate basic operations on a fictional bank account
I made this program because it was a challenge in one of my Udemy classes (Total Python: Become an advenced Python developer in 16 days). It is very basic, it can only do 3 function (deposit, withdraw, exit). It has no restrictions in regarding to user input yet.
