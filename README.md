# Bank_account_Project
It's a simple program which simulate basic operations on a fictional bank account
I made this program because it was a challenge in one of my Udemy classes (Total Python: Become an advenced Python developer in 16 days). It is very basic, it can only do 3 function (deposit, withdraw, exit). It has no restrictions in regarding to user input yet. As I was working on this project I tried to deepen my knowledge about OOP programming and I managed to complete this project without looking for the solution.
